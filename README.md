## üìú Project Overview

Dyslexia is a common learning disability that affects reading, spelling, and writing. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improving educational outcomes. This project applies various machine learning techniques to build a reliable system for dyslexia detection. The solution processes behavioral data (e.g., reading speed, phonological assessments) to predict whether an individual has dyslexia.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- **Early Detection**: Detect dyslexia in individuals at an early stage through behavioral and cognitive analysis.
- **Accuracy**: Provide high-accuracy predictions using advanced machine learning models.
- **Scalability**: Build a scalable solution that can handle data from multiple individuals and environments.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - **Data Sources**: Behavioral data such as reading speed, phonological assessments, and comprehension tests.
   - **Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering to extract relevant patterns.
   
### 2. **Machine Learning Models**
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective for binary classification tasks like dyslexia detection.
   - **Random Forest**: Used for feature importance analysis and generating robust predictions.
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Applied for visual data (e.g., eye-tracking) to analyze patterns in visual attention and reading behavior.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Used as a baseline model for comparison.

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1 Score**
   - A confusion matrix is generated to measure performance and evaluate false positives and negatives.
